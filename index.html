        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Ayaa and I am a current undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. As of right now my major is undeclared, however I do express an interest in Political Science. In the future I aspire to pursue a career in medicine. Before my acceptance to the University of California, Riverside I was a student at Cypress High School where I began my journey to get to where I am today. Throughout high school I did many activities to gain experience before entering college. To start, I studied Spanish during my four years at Cypress High School and now I am fluent in both reading, speaking, listening, and writing. I am also a native Arabic speaker. In total I speak three languages, and I am currently working on learning my fourth. I also participated in many clubs throughout high school. I even gained leadership positions in two of the clubs I joined. <br><br>

        During my sophomore year of high school, I served as the Public Relations officer for my schoolâ€™s Muslim Student Association. I also served as the Activities Chair of Cypress Culture Club in my junior year. Cypress Culture Club allowed me to join the University of California, Irvine DIRHA program. DIRHA stands for Diversity Inclusion and Racial Healing Ambassadors. Through this program I was able to learn more about diversity, and inclusion. As a result of the newly acquired knowledge from DIRHA, I was able to promote what I learned at Cypress High School. In addition to that, I participated in my school districts AIME program. AIME stands for Anaheim Internship Mentorship Experience. Through AIME, I was able to gain internship experience. I interned at Healthy Smiles for Kids of Orange County in which my eyes were opened as to what the work experience is like. Through Healthy Smiles for Kids of Orange County I was able to conduct a research study evaluating middle schoolerâ€™s knowledge on dental health. With the results acquired, I presented my research to the CEO of Healthy Smiles for Kids of Orange County. As a result of the study I had conducted, Healthy Smiles for Kids of Orange County was able to create an educational program for middle schoolers in which they were able to learn about the importance of dental health and taking care of their oral hygiene. 
<br><br>

         I am very appreciative of the experiences I had during high school. Without the opportunities I was presented, I wouldnâ€™t have been able to reach where I am today. I am also very blessed with being a student at the University of California, Riverside. The University of California, Riverside has already provided me with many experiences and I am sure that these opportunities will extend onto the future. Currently I am a member of the University of California, Riverside Healthy Hearts. Through Healthy Hearts I was able to join ERASE. ERASE has blessed me with many opportunities in expanding my career as a future medical student. I look forward to whatever it is that college brings next!
